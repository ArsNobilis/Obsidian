-   Gertruda’s childhood dog. You know, the missing teenager that the party will eventually find in Castle Ravenloft? The daughter of Mad Mary? That Gertruda.
    
-   Since Gertruda is an airheaded youth who believes heartily in fairy tales, I named the dog, Lancelot. The characters can find the name on the dog’s collar.
    
-   Having Lancelot join the party is not only a welcome bit of sweetness in this horror house, but also gives the party a non-player character to sacrifice in the basement. It’s a terrible thing to for them to deal with morally and that makes it all the better for this campaign.
