# Ranger

## Favored Enemy

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: [aberrations](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:aberration=1), [beasts](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:beast=1), [celestials](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:celestial=1), [constructs](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:construct=1), [dragons](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:dragon=1), [elementals](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:elemental=1), [fey](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:fey=1), [fiends](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:fiend=1), [giants](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:giant=1), [monstrosities](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:monstrosity=1), [oozes](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:ooze=1), [plants](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:plant=1), or [undead](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:undead=1). Alternatively, you can select two races of [humanoid](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:humanoid=1) (such as [gnolls](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#gnoll_mm) and [orcs](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#orc_mm)) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

## Natural Explorer
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:

-   Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
-   Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
-   Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
-   If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
-   When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
-   While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

## Fighting Style PHB p89[–]

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Archery PHB p72[–]

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

### Defense PHB p72[–]

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Two-Weapon Fighting PHB p72[–]

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

## Spellcasting PHB p89[–]

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See [chapter 10](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,10) for the general rules of spellcasting and [chapter 11](https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,11) for the [ranger spell list](https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:ranger=1).

### Spell Slots[–]

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your [ranger spells](https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:ranger=1) of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell [animal friendship](https://5e.tools/spells.html#animal%20friendship_phb) and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast [animal friendship](https://5e.tools/spells.html#animal%20friendship_phb) using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher[–]

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability[–]

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

## Ranger Archetype PHB p89[–]

## Hide in Plain Sight PHB p89[–]

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions.
